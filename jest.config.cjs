/**
 * NOTE ON `--forceExit` (in the `test` script, not here):
 *
 * `@snazzah/davey` — the DAVE voice-E2EE native addon pulled in transitively by
 * `@discordjs/voice` — registers a `CustomGC` handle on load that keeps the Node
 * process alive after the suite finishes. Jest reports it under
 * `--detectOpenHandles` as:
 *
 *     ●  CustomGC
 *          at requireNative (node_modules/@snazzah/davey/index.js:184:25)
 *
 * Locally the runner still exits; in CI, with no TTY, the job HUNG — two runs
 * sat at 45m and 2h30m, and because they never concluded they never reported
 * failure, so CI was gating nothing at all (disrecord#13).
 *
 * The handle is inside a third-party native module we do not control and cannot
 * unref, and the voice stack is loaded transitively by code under test, so
 * mocking it away would mean mocking most of the recording path. `--forceExit`
 * is the same lever cfg-core-server already pulls for this class of problem.
 *
 * The job also carries `timeout-minutes: 10` so a DIFFERENT future hang fails
 * fast and loudly instead of silently burning runner hours.
 *
 * @type {import('jest').Config}
